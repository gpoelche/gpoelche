## *Who is George?* ðŸ©»

I'm a student at Arizona State University studying Full-Stack Web Development. I am passionate about both effective, communicative design principles as well as user-interactivity on the web. Because of this, I see myself potentially becoming more interested in creating
web applications (whether it be in-browser games, analytics tools for video games, interactive websites for myself and other creatives, and more). I also see great opportunity for finding exciting and meaningful work in my home city of Pittsburgh, as the city continues
to attract more big names within the tech-industry to the City of Bridges. *Did you know that DuoLingo is based out of Pittsburgh and was created by two Carnegie Mellon University Students?* ðŸ¦‰

Recently, I've had interest in learning a game-development engine as a fun personal project. I'd initially considered working within the pyGame library, but am now attempting to learn GameMaker Studio and/or Godot. ðŸ‘¾

In my spare time, I shoot *plenty* of film photography, and have taken classes within darkroom environments. I'm currently creating my first photo-zine entitled *Strangers*, a short collection of photos of some of my favorite human beings captured within the past year and
some change in various locations (Pittsburgh, New York, and Chicago primarily). I seek to also apply the skills learned from my undergraduate experience to help further establish my personal brand as film photographer by creating an interactive and visually enjoyable
website/photo portfolio. 

You can find me at a few other places on the web:
